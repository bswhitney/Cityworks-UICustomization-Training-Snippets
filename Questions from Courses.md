## Answered Questions
**Question:** Is there a way to make a long data fields into shorter fields so you can fit another control onto the same row?

**Answer:** Yes. Using the browser's developer tools, I found that there are two classes that dictate the length of the field, *normal* and *long*. The following is a simple JavaScript solution for shrinking the Description combo box on a work order page:
```JavaScript
$(function () {
document.getElementById('ctl00_Main_cboWODesc').classList.remove('long');
document.getElementById('ctl00_Main_cboWODesc').classList.add('normal');
})
```
