# Cityworks-UICustomization-Training-Snippets
These are all of the code snippets used in the Cityworks UI Customization course.

## Folder Explanations
The contents of this repository follow the pattern used in the Cityworks UI Customization Course. Each folder or file in the root folder begins with a number. This number corresponds with the section number in the training manual. Within each folder, various txt, xml, and png files are numbered to correspond to their position within each section.

## Disclaimer.
Azteca Systems, its products, and its employees are not responsible for your implementation of this code. This code is to simply illustrate how the Cityworks UI can be customized with rather than provide ready-built code for your production environment. If you have any comments, concerns, or questions, feel free to ask me, Brandon Whitney.
