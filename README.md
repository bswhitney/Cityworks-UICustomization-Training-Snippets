# Cityworks-UICustomization-Training-Snippets
These are all of the code snippets used in the Cityworks UI Customization course.

## Folder and File Explanations
Two main folders exist within this repository:
**Cityworks-Conference-2019** contains information to be used in Cityworks Conference 2019 UI Optimization course.
**Web-Training** is the folder that corresponds with the UI Customization web training that is offered monthly. The contents of this folder generally follow the pattern used in the Cityworks UI Customization Course. Each section corresponds with a section in the manual.
**Questions from Courses.md** contains a list of questions I have recieved during training, and answers to those questions I have researched.

## Version
These code snippets are up to date with **Cityworks 15.4**. Note that snippets may or may not work for other versions of the software.

## Disclaimer
Azteca Systems, its products, and its employees are not responsible for your implementation of this code. This code is to simply illustrate how the Cityworks UI can be customized with rather than provide ready-built code for your production environment.
